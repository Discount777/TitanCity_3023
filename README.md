# TitanCity_2023
 
We've crafted a 2D isometric city builder game using the versatile Godot game engine, featuring assets crafted by our team members. Our game immerses players in the intriguing challenges of human survival on the harsh terrain of Titan.

Players will strategize and harness the rich methane rivers on the surface for valuable fertilizer, tap into the abundant water sources to fuel advanced fusion reactors, and even exploit the frozen surface to produce a vital resourceâ€”water.

In this project we used a tileset created by one of our members and extensive scripting, creating multiple functions to do things such as check if there are any building tiles adjacent to the tile pressed, another function to track the mouse and where it clicks so the buildings are able to be placed, one to total the resource pool and add to the resources depending on how many building tiles are placed as well as to check if the winning conditions are met (population of 200) and a multitude of others to do things such as changing between building modes and to transition between scenes. 

This is the very first game that any of our members have developed and it has been a very informative and valuable learning experience for the four of us.
